## XML SAX parser to extract digital traces from MAGNET XML reports generated by  AXIOM PROCESS tool and represent them into CASE Observables complied with UCO/CASE ontologies

The parser extracts some digital traces (Cyber items) from XML reports generated by MAGNET AXIOM PROCESS  and convert them into UCO/CASE as JSON-LD files.

The parser is able to process any report, regardless their size.

The parsers has been developed using **Python, version 3.x** and is based on **SAX** (Simple API for XML).

The AXIOM parser is composed of three different modules:

* parser_AXIOMtoCASE (main program: SAX parser)
* AXIOMtoJSON.py (class for generating the JSON-LD files of the UCO/CASE ontology)

## Requirements
The tool has been developed in Python version 3.x and here are some required modules:

* xml.sax (SAX classes)
* string (string utilities)
* argparse (args input management)
* os (operating system utilities)
* codecs (UTF-8 and other codec management)
* re (regular expressions management)
* uuid (global unique identifier management)
* timeit
* time 
* json

## Usage

> *parser_AXIOMtoCASE.py  [-h]*
>                       *-r INFILEXML*
>                       *-o OUTPUT_JSON*
>                       *-e type of device: mobile or disk*

where:

* -h, --help (shows the help message, including the AXIOM PROCESS versions supported, then exit)
* -r | --report INFILEXML (the AXIOM XML report to be processed, compulsory parameter)
* -o | --output OUTPUT_JSON (JSON-LD file to be generated, compulsory)
* -e | --evidence type of device: mobile or disk (HD, SD, USB), compulsory

## Mobile Forensic Data set
The parser has been developed and tested relying on a huge collection of mobile forensic dataset. This is composed of images made available on the Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets  (CFReDS) Project and also on those provided by Cellebrite within he Catch The Flag annual competition.

## CASE representation: JSON-LD files
All the XML reports have been processed to generate the corresponding CASE representation of the following traces, or facet according to the CASE terminology:

* Call
* Cell Tower (drafting)
* Chat (Whatsapp, Skype, etc.)
* Contact
* Cookie
* Email
* Event
* File
* Searched item (drafting)
* SMS
* URL History
* Wifi Connection (drafting)
* Chain of Evidence
* Context
  * Device
  * Tool


## Ontologies compatibility
The JSON-LD files generated are complied with the recent version of CASE/UCO ontologies, at the moment CASE 0.4 / UCO 0.6.
